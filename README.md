# Fruitables

Fruitables is a clean and responsive landing page built with HTML and CSS. It was designed as part of a front-end challenge to improve UI/UX skills and master layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid. The page features modern sectioning, semantic HTML structure, and a consistent design system with well-organized components including navigation, hero section, feature highlights, testimonials, and a call to action. The project focuses on performance, maintainability, and accessibility. All code is written from scratch without using any CSS frameworks or JavaScript, making it a great example of how to build a lightweight yet visually appealing landing page using only HTML and CSS.
